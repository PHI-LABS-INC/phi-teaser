## Sign Protocol

Evaluating artists In Phi Protocol, artwork created by artists is associated with credential NFTs. Community members can use [Ethsign](https://scan.sign.global/) to attest to these artworks, allowing them to evaluate the artists. When an artist who creates outstanding artworks receives a large number of attestations from members, the evaluation of that artist is visualized.
