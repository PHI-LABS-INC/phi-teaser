              <BlankSpace id="identity">{puzzle["identity"] === "identity" ? puzzleSticker["identity"] : null}</BlankSpace> lies at the
              heart of social networks, essentially responding to the question "Who are you?" Based on this, you can socialize, build your
              social graph, and engage with digital content. With the rise of the decentralized internet, we‚Äôre entering a whole new era of
              digital identity.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In web3, onchain transactions are the building blocks for your onchain identity. Unlike web2, these transactions emerge as a
              distinct and openly accessible dataset for everyone.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              However, there's no dedicated platform for crafting an onchain persona that encapsulates both your past and present. We are
              limited by dashboards that show your current onchain status and this is not enough.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Our mission is to give you as much freedom as possible to shape, express, and share your onchain identity from your onchain
              footprints. Phi aims to unlock the social and financial benefits inherent in your onchain identity, enhancing your presence
              within the decentralized internet.

            <h2>Our Journey</h2>
            <p>
              Phi embarked on its journey in January 2021, driven by a question: How can users uniquely{" "}
              <BlankSpace id="express">{puzzle["express"] === "express" ? puzzleSticker["express"] : null}</BlankSpace> their onchain
              identity?
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              This led to the creation of{" "}

                Phi Land

              on the timeline. The goal was to visualize onchain transaction data uniquely. In this vision, users would utilize PhiLand as
              their onchain profile, creating a seamless connection between their digital identity and blockchain interactions.
            </p>
            <br />

              This approach not only personalizes the blockchain experience but also integrates it into a broader social context, bridging
              the gap between transactional data and personal expression.

              We‚Äôre entering our new chapter with Phi Protocol, an open credentialing protocol for onchain identity. We‚Äôre working on our
              vision not as one dApp, but as an ecosystem built on Phi Protocol.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In contrast to Phi Land, where the decision of what onchain activities to visualize was made by the Phi team and Partner
              Protocol team, Phi Protocol empowers anyone to create any ‚Äò
              <BlankSpace id="cred">{puzzle["cred"] === "cred" ? puzzleSticker["cred"] : null}</BlankSpace>‚Äô that is meaningful to
              individuals or communities.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              While eBoy‚Äôs artwork is amazing on Phi Land, Phi Protocol allows for a variety of content visuals and formats that express
              Creds. Content can be anything you want: artwork (2D, 3D, pixel, and others), pictures, GIFs, movies, text, scores, in-game
              objects, attestations, and more.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              This shift opens up endless possibilities, making the process permissionless and inspiring personal creativity in the realm of
              onchain credentials. Through Phi Protocol, we aim to empower you to fully express yourself onchain.

            <h2>Reclaim the sovereignty of your identity</h2>
            <p>
              Phi Protocol heralds a paradigm shift. Unlike traditional credentialing platforms, our protocol is a fully community-driven
              credential system dedicated to onchain identity.
